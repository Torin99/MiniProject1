## Overview:

This repository contains code and analysis for a machine learning project comparing the performance of two classification models, k-nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Logistic Regression, on four distinct datasets. The project also includes experiments to find the best hyperparameters for the models.

## Datasets:

### 1. Ionosphere Dataset:
- **Description:** Radar measurements collected in Goose Bay, Labrador, focusing on radar returns from free electrons in the ionosphere.
- **Preprocessing:** Features converted to floating-point numbers, labels mapped to binary values (0 for "bad" radars, 1 for "good" radars).

### 2. Adult Dataset:
- **Description:** Income dataset predicting whether individualsâ€™ income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.
- **Preprocessing:** Numerical data converted to floats, labels mapped to binary values (0 for income under $50K, 1 for income over $50K).

### 3. Rice Dataset:
- **Description:** Dataset of rice grain images for two species - Cammeo and Osmancik.
- **Preprocessing:** Labels mapped to binary values (0 for Cammeo, 1 for Osmancik).

### 4. Mushroom Dataset:
- **Description:** Dataset of 23 species of mushrooms classified as poisonous or edible.
- **Preprocessing:** Labels mapped to binary values (1 for edible mushrooms, 0 for poisonous mushrooms).

## Models:

### 1. Logistic Regression:
- **Implementation:** Full-batch gradient descent optimization.
- **Features:** Utilizes learning rates to train the model.
- **Experimentation:** Tested with different learning rates using 5-fold cross-validation.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN):
- **Implementation:** Implemented using custom functions.
- **Features:** Explores different values of K to find the best hyperparameter.
- **Experimentation:** Evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation.
